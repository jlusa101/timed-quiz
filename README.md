# Timed Quiz

## Purpose
A website that allows the user to do a multiple choice quiz based on fundamental JavaScript. 

## Instructions

When the user clicks "Start Quiz", they are presented with a question and the timer starts counting down. If user answers a question correctly, they are informed of it. If the user answers a question incorrectly, they are informed of it and ten seconds are deducted from the timer.

After all questions are answered, the user is presented with a chance to enter their initials on the high score board as well as their score. After submitting, the user can view the high score board. From here, the user can go back to the beginning or clear the high score board and then go back to the beginning.
